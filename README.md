I've developed a project focusing on using a Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes classifier for fake news detection. This repository includes the code and documentation for the classifier, designed to accurately categorize news articles as either fake or real. It features various preprocessing techniques and feature selection methods that enhance the model's performance. The repository is structured to be user-friendly, with clear instructions on how to implement the classifier, making it a practical tool for organizations seeking to automate the process of detecting misinformation.
